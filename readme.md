# aws sso tool
The missing AWS SSO cli tool

### Functionality
- AWS web console
    - Easily launch the AWS web console from the CLI
    - Easily use multiple concurrent console sessions, 
      with the help of firefox containers
- Auth and credential sync
    - Simple interactive SSO login
    - Sync SSO credentials to `~/.aws/credentials`so they 
      can be used by tools that don't directly support SSO
